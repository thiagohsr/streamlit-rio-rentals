# Specification Quality Checklist: Chat Filter Assistant

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — all 3 resolved (FR-009:
      fixed config; FR-010: most-recent-turn only; FR-011: auto-apply)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (provider-switching UX, debug view
  scope, filter application mode) were resolved by the user choosing option
  A for each: fixed config, most-recent-turn-only debug view, and
  auto-apply. Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan`.
